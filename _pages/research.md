**Unemployment Insurance as a Financial Stabilizer: Evidence from Large Benefit Expansions** (with [Nick Flamang](https://nickflamang.github.io/))
[[**draft**]](/files/UI_Benefit_Expansions_and_Local_Financial_Distress.pdf)

**Abstract**: To what extent does unemployment insurance (UI) attenuate aggregate financial responses to unemployment shocks? We answer this question using administrative credit bureau records and the unprecedented changes in unemployment and UI generosity during the Covid-19 pandemic. We first estimate monthly aggregate delinquency-unemployment elasticities between January 2017 and March 2021, finding sharp decreases of 50% for auto loans and 66% for credit cards over the pandemic period. To isolate the effect of UI from other contemporaneous policies shifting unemployment shock sensitivity, we employ a staggered event study design around state-level withdrawals from federal UI programs in late 2021. We find that almost all of the pandemic elasticity drop is attributable to UI expansions. Our two designs are qualitatively robust to placebo tests on plausibly unaffected credit types, potential demand-side responses for increased credit, and alternate estimation specifications. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, we calculate that UI expansions thus prevented about 59% of total potential delinquency-months. Taken together, these results imply that federal UI expansions have had a substantially stabilizing effect during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings thus provide powerful empirical support for a largely theoretical body of research on the role of UI as an automatic stabilizer of aggregate economic conditions.
