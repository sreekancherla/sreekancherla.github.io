[**Unemployment Insurance as a Financial Stabilizer: Evidence from Large Benefit Expansions**](/files/UI_Benefit_Expansions_and_Local_Financial_Distress.pdf) (with [Nick Flamang](https://nickflamang.github.io/))

<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary>

To what extent does unemployment insurance (UI) attenuate aggregate financial responses to unemployment shocks? We answer this question using administrative credit bureau records and the unprecedented changes in unemployment and UI generosity during the Covid-19 pandemic. We first find that aggregate sensitivity to the unemployment rate decreased by 50% for auto loans and 66% for credit cards between January 2017 and March 2021. To isolate the effect of UI from other contemporaneous policies shifting unemployment shock responsiveness, we employ a staggered event study design around state-level withdrawals from federal UI programs in late 2021. We find that almost all of the pandemic sensitivity drop is attributable to UI expansions. Our two designs are qualitatively robust to placebo tests on plausibly unaffected credit types, potential demand-side responses for increased credit, and alternate estimation specifications. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, we calculate that UI expansions prevented about 59% of total potential delinquency-months. Taken together, these results imply that federal UI expansions have had a substantially stabilizing effect during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings thus provide powerful empirical support for a largely theoretical body of research on the role of UI as an automatic stabilizer of aggregate economic conditions.

**Understanding Capital Gains Responses to Taxes using Transaction-Level Data** (with [Alisa Tazhitinova](https://alisatns.weebly.com/)) (*Draft coming soon!*)

<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary>

We study how individuals’ trading behavior responds to tax incentives using administrative transaction-level data on all taxable sales of broker-traded, directly held financial assets between 2011 and 2019. Our empirical design leverages a simple, salient, timing-based tax notch: in the U.S., assets held beyond one year qualify for a 10-20% reduction in capital gains rates. The size and granularity of the data allow us to study how this capital gains tax rate differentiation shapes individuals’ trading behaviors across narrowly defined demographic and income groups. We find that: (1) retiming responses around the tax rate notch are weak in general; (2) individuals make clear misoptimization errors by realizing gains just before the notch; and (3) this pattern can be explained by both heterogeneous capital gains responses by asset type combined with rigidities in individual trading styles. Finally, we use our empirical results to show theoretically that the weak deferral elasticities imply that a revenue-maximizing government would eliminate short- vs long-term tax differentiation.
