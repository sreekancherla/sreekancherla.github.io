I am a Financial Economist at the US Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis. My research analyzes ways in which the US tax, transfer, and social insurance system has shaped income, inequality, and labor market dynamics. A key emphasis of this research is to understand the ways in which workers respond to income shocks, with a particular focus on unemployment and job search. Some of my other projects study capital gains taxation, independent contracting, and tax enforcement.
