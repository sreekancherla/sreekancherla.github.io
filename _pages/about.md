I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, with research fields in public and labor economics. My research agenda generally analyzes ways in which the US tax, transfer, and social insurance system has shaped income, inequality, and labor market dynamics. A key emphasis of this research is to understand the ways in which workers respond to income shocks, with a particular focus on unemployment and job search. Some of my other projects study capital gains taxation, independent contracting, and tax enforcement.<br/>

**I am on the 2023/2024 academic job market.**

My job market paper examines how reduced liquidity during unemployment affects job seekers' reemployment outcomes and long-term earnings trajectories. Click [here](/files/UI_Delays_and_Job_Search_Kancherla_JMP.pdf) for a draft. Last update: 12/7/2023.<br/>
