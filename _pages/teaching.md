## Econ 131: Undergraduate Public Economics (Fall 2020)

All section materials for this course were hosted on bCourses [[link](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1497565)]. I received an Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) award, which is given to the top 10% of GSIs at UC Berkeley, for my teaching.
